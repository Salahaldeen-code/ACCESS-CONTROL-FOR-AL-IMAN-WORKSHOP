1**THIS PROJECT NOT FINISHED YET BECAUSE WE STILL IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER OF THE SUBMISSION BY THE END OF THIS SEMESTER THIS PROJECT WILL BE DONE AND UPLOADED WITH DETAILS TO GITHUB**


**Overview**


This repository shop the Unauthorized Access Alert System, an innovative security solution designed to enhance the safety of establishments during non-operational hours through advanced technology integration. Aimed primarily at places like car care shops, offices, and industrial facilities, this system utilizes face recognition technology, Raspberry Pi hardware, and a Flutter-based admin application connected to Google Firebase for real-time monitoring and immediate alerts on unauthorized access attempts.


**Project Details**


Face Recognition Technology: Employs deep learning algorithms to accurately identify and verify faces, significantly reducing false positives and ensuring reliable security. Raspberry Pi: Serves as the central control unit for seamless integration of hardware and software components, ensuring efficient and stable system performance. Flutter Admin Application: A user-friendly admin interface developed using Flutter for real-time monitoring, alert management, and system control directly from a smartphone or tablet. Google Firebase Integration: Leverages Firebase for cloud-based data storage, real-time database management, and instant push notifications to alert authorities and system administrators upon any unauthorized access attempt. Key Features Real-Time Alerts: Instant notifications when unauthorized access is detected, allowing for swift responses. Image Capture: Automatically captures the image of the intruder during the access attempt for further investigation and evidence collection. User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-navigate admin panel for system management, accessible via mobile devices. Scalable and Flexible: Designed to be scalable to various operational sizes and adaptable to different non-operational hour security needs. Objective The goal of this system is to proactively address and mitigate security vulnerabilities during non-operational hours, safeguarding valuable assets and enhancing overall security protocols through the integration of cutting-edge technology.


**Target Audience**


This system is ideal for business owners, security professionals, and tech enthusiasts interested in enhancing security measures using technology. It is particularly useful for those looking to protect establishments during vulnerable non-operational hours.
